                                <p><strong>Triheart</strong> is a tabletop role-playing game played with pencils,
                                    paper, and dice, with friends or acquaintances around a table. Triheart allows the

                                <p>Players each play one character within the fantasy world of Triheart. They work
                                    together
                                    with other players to succeed in challenges they face to achieve great things. The
                                    main
                                    concern of the players is to be part of a fun and exciting experience for everyone
                                    concerned. How well a player does is not measured in the wealth they acquire or
                                    power they
                                    wield in the game, but in how memorable the characters they play are, and how much
                                    they
                                    contribute to the enjoyment of the game.</p>
                                <h3>The Game Master</h3>
                                <p>The <strong>game master</strong>, or <strong>GM</strong> for short, is played by
                                    just one
                                    player. The game master is in charge of running everything about the world other
                                    than the
                                    characters the players are playing. The GM is in charge of describing the world and
                                    playing
                                    all characters nor being played by other players. The GM is the storyteller and
                                    also the
                                    final arbitrator of rules presented in this document if there is disagreement among
                                    the
                                    players. The GM&rsquo;s job is still for everyone to have fun, and a good GM will
                                    not only
                                    go by the book but is willing to go with what the table thinks if that will result
                                    in
                                    everyone having a good time.</p>

                                <h3>Dice</h3>
                                <p>The game uses standard polyhedral dice, available from all good gaming stores and
                                    online. The dice are referred to as d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20 after how many
                                    sides each kind of die has.</p>
                                <p>A d10 you have might have numbers from 0 to 9, rather than 1 to 10. With these dice
                                    the 0 is read as a 10 instead.</p>

                                <p><strong>Checks</strong> are made whenever a player character attempts to do
                                    something that is not guaranteed to succeed, such as picking a lock or hitting
                                    someone with a sword.</p>
                                <p>A check is a d20 roll made against a <strong>target number</strong> (<strong>TN</strong>).
                                    Checks made by character&rsquo;s use a specific attribute that is then added to the
                                    roll. A check is a success if the rolled number is equal or greater than the TN.</p>
                                <p>When a player wishes to do something, the GM will tell them what kind of a check
                                    they will have to make, and what TN it will be made against. If a player also
                                    wishes to know what the consequences of failing are, they can ask the GM.</p>
                                <h3>Skill Checks</h3>
                                <p>Often, specific skills will be used to make a check. These checks are known as
                                    <strong>skill checks</strong>.</p>
                                <p>When making a skill check, you add 5 to your roll per level of skill. For example,
                                    if a character with an Agility of 3 and two levels of skill in Dexterity attempts
                                    to pick a lock they will roll d20 + 3 + 10.</p>

                        <p>Combat is broken down into rounds of combat, usually referred to as <strong>rounds</strong>.</p>
                        <p>During a round every side of the battle takes a <strong>turn </strong>one after another.</p>
                        <p>During a turn every character on that side may do various things such as cast spells, swing
                            swords, and drink potions.</p>
                        <p>Characters on the same side act simultaneously or in any order they wish. For example,
                            during a turn a character can first do something, then wait for another character to act,
                            and then do something else.</p>


                        <h3>The Start of Combat</h3>
                        <p>At the start of combat, the GM decides which side of the battle acts first. Usually, this
                            will be the side initiating combat, the first to draw their weapons or charge forward.</p>
                        <p>If no side is acting before the others, all sides choose one character among them to make an
                            agility roll. The order of combat is defined by these rolls, with the sides with higher
                            rolls acting first. If multiple characters roll the same value, they roll between
                            themselves to determine the order.</p>
                        <h3>The Round and the Turn</h3>
                        During a round every character may take an action, a minor action, and they may move up to
                        their movement.
                        Additionally, all characters can talk freely, within reason.
                        A character may also declare that they would like to take a <strong>delayed turn</strong> and
                        act out of turn
                        order.

                    <div class="contentBlock">
                        <p>Combat in can be played out in one of two ways: <strong>quick combat</strong> and <strong>tactical
                                combat</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Quick combat is played similarly to normal gameplay with the GM describing the situation and
                            the players telling the GM what their characters wish to do.</p>
                        <p>Tactical combat is played using a grid with tokens and follows a much more comprehensive
                            ruleset.</p>
                        <p>Generally, only relatively short and simple battles should be played using quick combat. A
                            battle with many characters or a lot of complexity is hard to keep track of without the use
                            of tokens and a grid. Tactical combat is not necessary for something simple like beating up
                            one or two guards, if anything having to set up the grid and tokens for such a battle would
                            slow the game down.</p>
                        <p>The rules do work whichever method of running combat you decide on, and you can play using
                            only one of the systems, or without any combat at all.</p>
                        <p>If you choose not to use tactical combat, you ought to avoid having large fights, and
                            instead have the game mainly be focused on things other things such as exploration,
                            investigation, or social interaction.</p>

                        <p>Manoeuvres, spells, and other abilities list a range at which they can be used. Range is
                            noted as the number of tiles from you to the target. A range of 1 tile means that the
                            target must be adjacent, 2 tiles that there is one tile between you and the target.</p>
                        <p>You can think of 1 tile as being approximate to 1 metre.</p>
                        <p>When a range is noted in tiles, it is accompanied by one of the following ranges: self,
                            melee, close, short, long, and distant. The ranges are always used outside of tactical
                            combat for quick combat, chases, and general adventuring. Close, short, long, and distant
                            are shortened to C, S, L, and D.</p>

                        <p>Doing certain things in melee range of another character may allow them to do an attack of
                            opportunity.</p>
                        <p>An attack of opportunity is a melee basic attack. You may take it with any melee weapon you
                            are carrying or make an unarmed or improvised attack.</p>
                        <p><em>Things that provoke attacks of opportunity:</em></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Casting a spell or performing a manoeuvre that states that it provokes attacks of
                                opportunity</li>
                            <li>Using a basic attack with a two-handed ranged weapon</li>
                            <li>Performing first aid action</li>
                            <li>Moving out of melee range from another creature</li>
                            <li>Moving within the melee range of another creature</li>

                        <p>Attacks of opportunity happen before the action that provoked them is done. If a character
                            tries to move away from your melee range and your attack of opportunity makes them fall
                            unconscious, their movement is cancelled, and they stay within melee range. If a character
                            attempts a two-handed ranged weapon attack and your attack of opportunity kills them, the
                            ranged attack is not made.</p>

                            <li>You can move as long as you don&rsquo;t leave melee range of the target.</li>

                            <li>You cannot move.</li>
                            <li>As a minor action, you may attempt to escape the grapple. To do so contest your agility
                                against the grappler&rsquo;s strength.</li>
                            <li>As a minor action, you may attempt to escape the grapple and grapple the grappler. To

                        <h3>Shove</h3>
                        <p>As an action, you can shift a character or an object in melee range back a number of tiles
                            equal to your strength, or none if your strength is negative. You can only shove characters
                            and objects that are of such a size and weight that your character could realistically push
                            them.</p>
                        <h3>Help</h3>
                        <p>You can grant advantage on one check to another character in melee range. You can only help
                            with checks your character could actually help with. For example, distracting someone to
                            make it easier for your friend to pickpocket them, reaching out to help them climb, or
                            smacking away a foe&rsquo;s shield or weapon to help your friend attack.</p>
                        <h3>Perform First Aid</h3>
                        <p>As an action, you can heal a bloodied character in melee range. If the healing would raise
                            the character&rsquo;s health to above half of their maximum health, they are instead healed
                            to half of their health + 1.</p>
                        <p>You cannot perform first aid on yourself.</p>
                        <p>Performing first aid provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>
                        <p>The amount of healing done increases with levels of skill in Medicine (KNO).</p>

                        <p>Alternatively, you may also have an agreeing character in melee range drink a potion from
                            you.</p>
                        <h3>Situational Minor Actions</h3>
                        <p>During your turn you may want to do something that does not fit into any of the predefined
                            minor actions, such as pressing a button, searching a single pocket of a corpse, or wiping
                            your hand clean of noxious slime.</p>
                        <p>If the action would realistically take around 2 seconds or less, and your character could do
                            it, you may do it as a situational minor action.</p>
                        <p>The GM will then rule what kind of a check, if any, is to be rolled to determine your
                            success. Situational minor actions rarely require checks, since most things that would be
                            difficult enough to warrant one are proper actions, and not minor actions.</p>
                        <h3>Get up from being prone</h3>
                        <p>As a minor action, you may get up from being prone.</p>

                <h2>Delayed Turns</h2>
                <a id="Delayed Turns" class="anchor"></a>
                <div class="contentBlockWrapper">
                    <div class="contentBlock">
                        <p>A character may disrupt the regular flow of combat by declaring that they would like to take
                            a <strong>delayed turn</strong>. This allows you to take your turn in the middle of another
                            side&rsquo;s turn.</p>
                        <p>Doing so means you cannot move, take your action or minor action, or do anything else on
                            your actual turn.</p>
                        <p>Before doing anything on your turn, declare that you would like to take a delayed turn and
                            specify what will be the <strong>trigger</strong> for it.</p>
                        <p>The trigger is a single sentence, which describes a specific circumstance upon which you
                            will start your delayed turn.</p>
                        <p>A delayed turn declaration might sound something like &ldquo;I would like to take a delayed
                            turn when a hostile character goes through the doorway closest to me.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>The trigger in this declaration is &ldquo;A hostile character goes through the doorway
                            closes to me.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>If this circumstance happens before it would be your turn again, you may then at that moment
                            interrupt the ongoing turn and take your own. The hostile character will stop just
                            after completing the circumstance of the trigger, in this case moving through the doorway.</p>
                        <p>After you take your delayed turn, the round continues from where it left off.</p>
                        <p>If the declared trigger does not come up before it&rsquo;s your turn again, you will have
                            wasted your turn.</p>
                        <p>Also note that the GM is aware of what your trigger is and is allowed to play around it, for
                            example, avoiding triggering it (although a friendly GM shouldn&rsquo;t make it their life
                            goal to avoid all triggers).</p>
                        <p>The Game Master is allowed to take delayed turns but should do so sparingly to not
                            overcomplicate combat.</p>
