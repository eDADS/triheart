                            friends or acquaintances around a table. Triheart allows the players to tell stories of the
                            adventures
                            of heroes in a fantasy setting.</p>

                        <a id="The_Players" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p><strong>Players</strong> each play one character within the fantasy world of
                            Triheart. They work together with other players to experience various adventures.
                            How well a player does is not measured in the wealth they acquire or power they
                            wield in the game, but in how memorable the characters and adventures they play
                            are.</p>
                        <h3>The Game Master</h3>
                        <a id="The_Game_Master" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p>The <strong>game master</strong>, or <strong>GM</strong> for short, is a role taken
                            by just one participant in a game. The GM is in charge of running everything about
                            the world other than the characters the players are playing: describing the world
                            and playing all characters not being played by other players. The GM is the
                            storyteller and also the final arbiter of rules. Even more final than the rulebook.
                            The GM&rsquo;s main responsibility is that everyone is having fun, not following a
                            book.</p>
                        <h3>Dice</h3>
                        <a id="Dice" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p>The game uses standard polyhedral dice, available from all good gaming stores and
                            online. The dice are referred to as d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20 after how many
                            sides each kind of die has.</p>

                        <p>A <strong>character</strong> in Triheart is any being with agency. This means that all
                            humanoids, animals, monsters, demons, and objects brought to life by magic are characters.</p>

                        <h3>Attributes</h3>
                        <a id="Attributes" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p>Every character has a number of <strong>attributes</strong>, that represent various general
                            levels of capability of their person. Attributes are represented as number values where 0
                            is the average person. Generally, people vary from -6 to +6, with -6 being extraordinarily
                            bad, and +6 human peak performance. Note that attributes are broad, and while someone might
                            have +6 in knowledge, they will not be more knowledgeable than everyone on specific
                            subjects. Here are the 6 attributes in Triheart:</p>
                        <p><em>Strength</em></p>
                        <p>Sheer physical strength. A character&rsquo;s ability to use melee weapons, jump, climb, move
                            heavy objects, and perform feats of athleticism.</p>
                        <p><em>Agility</em></p>
                        <p>Nimbleness, reflexes, and accuracy. A character&rsquo;s ability to use ranged weapons,
                            perform acrobatics, sneak around, and evade incoming attacks.</p>
                        <p><em>Vitality</em></p>
                        <p>Ability to withstand injury, poisons, and illness. Determines a character&rsquo;s health.</p>
                        <p><em>Knowledge</em></p>
                        <p>Memory and knowledge. A character&rsquo;s ability to recall information, and the breadth and
                            depth of their general knowledge.</p>
                        <p><em>Instinct</em></p>
                        <p>Mind and perception. A character&rsquo;s ability to hear the feintest of sounds, notice the
                            smallest facial expressions, ability to make split second decisions, and the willpower to
                            stay clam under pressure.</p>
                        <p><em>Charisma</em></p>
                        <p>Social skills and communication. A character&rsquo;s ability to make themselves be
                            understood, to impress, and to make others believe.</p>
                        <p>Note that a character&rsquo;s charisma has nothing to do with how they look but is solely
                            the force of their character in social situations.</p>

                        <h3>Skills</h3>

                        <p>Each attribute has associated with it a wide variety of <strong>skills</strong>. A skill is
                            a more specific application of an attribute. A character can have 0&ndash;3 levels in a
                            particular skill, from not trained at all to being an expert. Here are the skills and their

                        <h3>Character Creation</h3>
                        <a id="Character_Creation" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p>In Triheart the players play human characters. To create a character to play follow these
                            steps in order. Characters should be created together as a group at the table the first
                            time you&rsquo;re playing. Try to create characters that work well together, have different
                            but complementary strengths and weaknesses.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong><em> Roll attributes</em></strong></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Your character&rsquo;s attributes are determined by rolling them one at a time. First,
                            choose the attribute you want to roll. Roll a d6. If the sum of your attributes would go
                            past 6, take the roll as negative number instead.</p>
                        <p>For example, if you first decide to roll for vitality and get a 4, your vitality is set to
                            +4. Then you decide to roll for agility and get a 3, your agility would be set to -3, since
                            4+3 would go over 6. Third you might roll for knowledge and get a 5, and your knowledge
                            would be set to +5, since 5+4-3 is not more than 6. Keep doing this until you have rolled
                            all of your attributes.</p>

                        <p>Your health and maximum health are set to 20 + 2 &times; vitality. If you have -3 vitality,
                            for example, your health would be 14, since it&rsquo;s 20 + 2 &times; (-3) = 20 - 6.</p>

                        <p><strong>Checks</strong> are made whenever a player character attempts to do something risky,
                            such as climbing a wall or hitting someone with a sword. Note that checks should not be
                            made if there is nothing at risk. If the player characters can just keep trying until they
                            succeed without risk, no check needs to be made. The player characters are just able to do
                            it.</p>
                        <p>A check is a d20 roll made against a <strong>target number</strong> (<strong>TN</strong>).
                            Checks made by characters use a specific attribute that is then added to the roll. A
                            check is a success if the rolled number is equal or greater than the TN.</p>
                        <p>When a player wishes to do something, the GM will tell them what kind of a check they will
                            have to make, and what TN it will be made against. If a player also wishes to know what the
                            consequences of failing are, they can ask the GM.</p>

                        <p>When making a skill check, you add 5 to your roll per level of skill. For example, if a
                            character with an agility of +3 and two levels of skill in dexterity, each level giving
                            them +5, attempts to pick a lock, they will roll d20 + 3 + 10.</p>

                        <h3>Advantage</h3>
                        <a id="Advantage" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p>If there is something greatly helping or hindering a character making a check, they may make
                            the check with <strong>advantage</strong> or <strong>disadvantage</strong>. To make a check
                            with advantage simply roll an additional d20 and pick the highest. To make a check with
                            disadvantage roll an additional d20 and pick the lowest.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes a character may have multiple levels of advantage or disadvantage. If you have 2
                            levels of advantage you roll two additional d20s and pick the highest. If you have both
                            advantage and disadvantage, each level of advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out.
                            For example, if you have 2 levels of advantage and 3 levels of disadvantage, first 2 levels
                            of both cancel each other out leaving you with just normal disadvantage.</p>

                        <a id="Contested_Checks" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p>Conflict between players should be avoided, the party is a party for a reason. However,
                            sometimes players may want to make checks against one another. In this case they will roll
                            a <strong>contest</strong>.</p>
                        <p>In a contest, players roll against each other&rsquo;s rolls instead of against a set TN.
                            Whoever rolls higher succeeds, the other fails. A tied roll means that neither succeeds.</p>
                        <h3>Group Checks</h3>
                        <a id="Group_Checks" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p>When many characters attempt to do something together, they all roll together in a <strong>group
                                check</strong>. For them to fail, more than half of the characters must fail, otherwise
                            they succeed. The most common uses for group checks are stealth checks when moving
                            together, climbing together, surviving in the wilds, and group social checks.</p>
                        <p>Group checks do not require for all the characters to be using the same attributes or
                            skills. For example, lockpicking can be a group check where one person makes a dexterity
                            check to pick the lock, while others make stealth checks to stay hidden or deception checks
                            to draw attention away from the person picking the lock.</p>

                        <a id="Health" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p><strong>Health</strong> represents how far a character is from death.</p>
                        <p>A character has a <strong>maximum health</strong> and a <strong>current health</strong>.
                            Current health is simply referred to as a character&rsquo;s health.</p>
                        <p>A character&rsquo;s health can never exceed their maximum health. A character&rsquo;s health
                            can be negative, but no less than the inverse of their maximum health (their maximum health
                            but negative).</p>
                        <p>Once a character&rsquo;s health is half of their maximum health or less, they become <strong>bloodied</strong>.
                            The character is visibly hurt and can be healed up using first aid.</p>
                        <p>Outside of combat characters can regain health up to half of their maximum health (rounded
                            down) + 1 once they get a minute to breath and perform first aid.</p>
                        <h3>Below 1 Health</h3>
                        <a id="Below_1_Health" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p>When a player character takes damages that would make them fall below 1 health, they make a
                            TN15 vitality check. If they fail the check, they immediately take they take the damage,
                            going to negative health or 0, and collapse <strong>unconscious</strong>. While
                            unconscious, a player cannot defend themselves, and all melee attacks deal double damage.
                            If they succeed on the vitality check, they instead fall to 0 health and unconscious at the
                            end of their next turn.</p>
                        <p>If a player character&rsquo;s health ever reaches the inverse of their maximum health they
                            <strong>die</strong> instantly.</p>
                        <p>Non-player characters die once they reach 0 health and get no chance at making a vitality
                            check. If the players are attacking a non-player character, they can choose to not kill
                            them and just knock them unconscious. This does require that the method of reducing the
                            character&rsquo;s health is one that could just knock them unconscious without killing them
                            outright.</p>
                        <h3>Death</h3>
                        <a id="Death" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p>Once a character reaches the inverse of their maximum health, they die. Player characters
                            however have ambitious souls filled with determination and will do everything in their
                            power to keep going for a bit longer.</p>
                        <p>Once a player character dies their soul keeps living through player characters still alive.
                            During this time the now dead character has no physical form, occupies no space, and has no
                            health. They can still continue communicating with the rest of the group, and even use
                            manoeuvres and spells through them. On your turn, you may use any spells, manoeuvres, or
                            other abilities such as those given to you by your class, as if a willing party member of
                            your choice were using them. If the ability uses mana, you must spend your own mana to cast
                            it, not the party member&rsquo;s. If an ability requires a condition to be met, such as
                            being in a certain position relative to another character, the party member you are using
                            your abilities through must meet those requirements.</p>
                        <p>The soul of a dead player character finally moves from this world to the next once the
                            immediate situation at hand is resolved. For example, if the players are taking part in a
                            large battle, the soul will leave once the battle ends. How long it takes for the soul to
                            move on varies by situation, and should be decided by table consensus, and ultimately by
                            the GM.</p>
                        <p>A player character dying is not the end of the game however. Once the soul has moved on, the
                            player may create a new character. The new character should be introduced to the party in a
                            smooth way that fits in with the story, possibly the next time the party gets to a town or
                            city.</p>

                        <p>Player characters can recover health and mana by <strong>resting</strong>. To rest, player
                            characters must stop to eat and patch up for at least 15 minutes. Resting once uses up one
                            inventory slot&rsquo;s worth of food. Resting recovers both health and mana to full.</p>

                        <a id="Sleeping" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p>To <strong>sleep</strong>, player characters must sleep for approximately 8 hours. To sleep
                            a character must not be exposed to the elements, for example being in the freezing cold,
                            and must have rested and eaten at least once that day.</p>
                        <p>Sleeping gives the same bonuses as resting: recovering health and mana to full but does not
                            require food.</p>
                        <p>Going for long periods without sleep will cause sleep deprivation, whose effects are listed

                        <p>Each character has an inventory with 10 slots for items, not including things part of your
                            person such as fake teeth or non-armoured clothes you are wearing.</p>
                        <p>Different kinds of objects take a different number of slots in your inventory depending on
                            how difficult they are to carry. Every unique kind of item does however take at least one
                            slot, no matter how small or easy to carry to avoid having indefinitely long lists of small
                            trinkets. Multiples of the same item can stack if they take less than one slot.</p>
                        <p>How many slots an item takes is written with a bracket notation. For example &acute;[1] Book
                            of the Dead&rsquo; takes one slot, &lsquo;[6] Plate Armour&rsquo; takes 6 slots, and
                            &lsquo;[1/5] Candle&rsquo; means that 5 candles take 1 slot; if you only have the one slot,
                            it still hogs the whole slot however, but if you acquire more candles they can be stacked
                            into the one slot. Here are some examples of how many slots different objects take.</p>
                        <p><em>Objects that take one slot: </em>books, potion bottles, grappling hooks, hand mirrors,
                            rations, keys.</p>
                        <p><em>Objects that take 2 slots:</em> one-handed weapons, brooms, ukuleles.</p>
                        <p><em>Objects that take 3 slots:</em> ranged weapons, foldable chairs, outfits, banjos.</p>
                        <p><em>Objects that take 4 slots:</em> two-handed weapons, chairs, guitars.</p>
                        <p><em>Objects that take 6 slots:</em> tents, cellos.</p>
                        <p><em>Objects that take less than 1 slot:</em> [1/5] candles, [1m/5m] rope, [1/50]
                            marbles.</p>

                        <p>The same currency is used everywhere in Triheart (although the coins are minted differently
                            depending on place of origin, the value is the same everywhere). There are three coins:
                            copper, silver, and gold. To keep money easy to understand, just imagine one copper is
                            equal to one euro, pound, or dollar, depending on which currency you are most comfortable
                            with; the values of these currencies are similar enough that it shouldn&rsquo;t matter. A
                            silver piece is worth 10 copper (&asymp;10 &euro;&pound;$), and a gold piece worth 10
                            silver (&asymp;100 &euro;&pound;$).</p>
                        <p>The standard setting in Triheart is pre-industrial, and the prices should reflect that.
                            While steam power exists, there are no general-purpose steam engines that can be plonked
                            down for mass production.</p>

                        <p><strong>Values </strong>are things a character holds in extremely high regard, principles
                            that are important in themselves. When roleplaying a character, you should always try and
                            follow your values, and going against them should be a considered choice only made with
                            extremely good reason. Over time a character&rsquo;s values may change as the character
                            grows, and you are allowed to change your values when you think it would be appropriate.
                            Again, changing them should be a thing that only happens with good reason.</p>
                        <p><em>Examples of values</em></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Honesty</li>
                            <li>Asceticism, poverty</li>
                            <li>Wealth, luxury</li>
                            <li>Non-violence</li>
                            <li>Being one with nature</li>
                            <li>Spreading an ideology (your choice)</li>
                            <li>Optimism</li>
                            <li>Honour, loyalty</li>
                            <li>Environmentalism</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Personal Values</h3>
                        <a id="Personal_Values" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p><strong>Personal values</strong> are values a character expects of themselves, but does not
                            expect, or even want, of anyone else. Personal values the strongest kind of value and going
                            against them should be done rarely, if ever. For example, a character that has the personal
                            value of poverty will refuse any gold given to them but doesn&rsquo;t mind if others around
                            them decide to gather wealth.</p>
                        <h3>Universal Values</h3>
                        <a id="Universal_Values" class="anchor"></a>

                        <img src="rulebook_images/threehearts.svg" class="blockImage lightmodeImage" height="300" width="300">
                        <img src="rulebook_images/threeheartsDarkmode.svg" class="blockImage darkmodeImage hidden-content"
                            height="300" width="300">

                        <p><strong>Universal values</strong> are values a character expects not only of themselves, but
                            also of anyone and everyone, and wishes that they could reach them. A universal value is
                            one that the character does not only follow themselves, but also wants to help others
                            achieve. A character that holds a specific universal value will not only try to follow it
                            themselves but will try to have everyone around them do so as well and will see others
                            going against them as doing something morally wrong. For example, a character that has the
                            universal value of poverty will not only refuse gold but will also despise the rich and try
                            to talk others into giving away their wealth as well.</p>
                        <h3>Goals &amp; Soul Essence</h3>
                        <a id="Goals_and_Soul_Essence" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p>At the beginning of each session, everyone at the table should gather around to choose some
                            <strong>goals </strong>for their characters. Each character should choose at least one goal
                            for themselves. Each goal must be related to a specific personal or universal value the
                            character holds. These goals are chosen openly at the table, and players should try to
                            choose goals at least some of them can share to make it easier for them to be completed or
                            choose goals that can be easily pursued together. For example, if one player has the
                            personal value of wealth they may choose as their goal to burgle a mansion, another who has
                            the universal value of equality might make it their goal to redistribute some of the wealth
                            from the mansion to the poor. Goals should be something substantial, actual goals, and not
                            trivial to achieve. After accomplishing a goal player receive 1 <strong>essence</strong>.</p>
                        <p>A player can use up 1 essence at any point to reroll a check after they&rsquo;ve made it as
                            long as the check is made to directly pursue personal or universal values. Trying to break
                            a lock to free slaves would be directly pursuing the universal value of freedom but
                            attempting to steal money to buy lockpicking tools to open up the slaves&rsquo; chains
                            would not be, since it is far too indirect.</p>

                        <p>In Triheart distance is measured in <strong>tiles</strong>. One tile is approximate to 1
                            metre, or 3 feet. You may talk about distance in terms of metres or feet, or any other
                            unity distance you are comfortable with, but all mechanics within the system are defined
                            using the tile unit.</p>
                        <h3>Range</h3>
                        <a id="Range" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p><strong>Range</strong> is a distance between two characters or objects, most commonly used
                            to signify how far away something is from a character. For something to be in the range of
                            1 tile of a character means that the two characters are adjacent. For something to be in 2
                            tiles&rsquo; range means that there is one tiles between the character and the target.</p>
                        <p>When talking about range, it is often practical to use less exact measurements, so when we
                            note a in tiles, it is accompanied by one of the following range brackets: <strong>self</strong>,
                            <strong>melee</strong>, <strong>close</strong>, <strong>short</strong>, <strong>long</strong>,
                            and <strong>distant</strong>. These inexact ranges should be used when not using a grid, to
                            help everyone quickly form a picture of what is happening. The ranges are usually shortened
                            to single letters: close, short, long, and distant become <strong>C</strong>, <strong>S</strong>,
                            <strong>L</strong>, and <strong>D</strong> respectively.</p>

                        <p>In quick combat there is an infinite amount of directions, just like in the physical world.</p>
                        <p>In tactical combat there are 8 main directions, which are used when a spell or manoeuvre
                            asks for a direction.</p>
                        <p>In some rare cases, you may have to use additional directions for up and down, and between
                            those and the main directions.</p>

                        <p><strong>Abilities </strong>are specific and defined things characters can do. Abilities
                            cover a wide variety of things a character can gain from their class, items, or various
                            other means, as well as some abilities everyone has.</p>
                        <h3>Class Features</h3>
                        <a id="Class_Features" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p><strong>Class features</strong> are abilities granted by classes that define a class. They
                            can be almost anything, such as the Necromancer&rsquo;s ability to raise undead thralls, or
                            the Fighter&rsquo;s ability to slice arrows from the air to defend themselves.</p>

                        <a id="Manoeuvres" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p><strong>Manoeuvres </strong>are physical abilities, such as the Fighter&rsquo;s ability to
                            cleave multiple targets with one attack, or the Monk&rsquo;s ability to heighten their
                            senses to feel what characters there are nearby.</p>
                        <p>Manoeuvres list the time they take, at what ranged they are effective, what the manoeuvres
                            can target, and what each manoeuvre does. Some of these may not be listed for every
                            manoeuvre if they are not applicable, or if what the manoeuvre does explains it.</p>
                        <h3>Spells</h3>
                        <a id="Spells" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p><strong>Spells </strong>are magical abilities, such as the Wizard&rsquo;s ability to remove
                            friction from a surface, or the Cleric&rsquo;s ability to force a confession out of
                            someone.</p>
                        <p>Spells are like magical manoeuvres, the only difference being the fact they&rsquo;re magic
                            and have a mana cost. Mana is lost immediately upon starting to cast a spell.</p>
                        <h3>Appeals</h3>
                        <a id="Appeals" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p><strong>Appeals</strong> are social abilities, such as the Rogue&rsquo;s ability to explain
                            away accusations, or the Necromancer&rsquo;s ability to use an undead thrall to scare
                            someone.</p>

                    <div class="contentBlock">
                        <p>A <strong>challenge</strong> is a larger task or situation that contains within it many
                            actions and checks. While a check might be something like hitting someone with a sword or
                            telling a lie, the situation that it happens in, a battle or a social interaction, is a
                            challenge.</p>
                        <h3>Gauntlets</h3>
                        <a id="Gauntlets" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p>In many situations a single failed check does not mean that the whole thing goes
                            irreversibly bad. When there is a situation which is large in scope requiring multiple
                            checks to resolve, it is best to use a <strong>gauntlet</strong>. In a gauntlet for the
                            players to completely fail they must fail multiple checks, or have multiple things go
                            wrong. A common use for gauntlets is moving in stealth for an extended period of time. When
                            a gauntlet is used, the GM will define how many levels of <strong>escalation</strong> you
                            will go through before failure.</p>
                        <p>For example, let us imagine the players are trying to sneak into a guarded fortress. The
                            gauntlet might look something like this.</p>

                            should only happen as a result of poor decision making, not poor luck. Similarly, the
                            players may be able to reverse a level of escalation, for example if they silently knock
                            the first guard unconscious before they have time to tell the others, going from escalation
                            level 2 to 0.</p>

                        <p>A <strong>chase</strong> is a challenge where characters are pursuing other characters. The
                            players can be either be the ones escaping or the ones chasing someone else.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;A chase begins by determining what range everyone is at. Most chases will begin at
                            either short or long range, and infrequently at close or distant range. Then, the GM should
                            determine if there is a set end point for the chase. If the players are chasing someone,
                            whoever is being chased probably has some destination they are going to, perhaps someone
                            that might help them to fight off the players. In such a situation the GM should decide
                            that if the chase goes on for longer than a set amount of turns, it ends and transitions
                            into another kind of situation, perhaps someone&rsquo;s friends jumping and beating up the
                            players.</p>
                        <p>Chases operate in turns. At the start of a turn everyone makes an agility check. The GM
                            should only roll once using an agility score representative of the characters being rolled
                            for, even if the side they&rsquo;re playing has multiple characters. All player characters
                            who roll above or equal to the GM may move either one range bracket closer or further away,
                            depending if they are chasing or being chased. Every player who rolls below the GM instead
                            falls behind by one range bracket.</p>
                        <p>After the ability check the players may spend one action and one minor action on abilities
                            they have, or better yet improvise something. For example, if the players are the ones
                            being chased through a busy market, they may pull down market stalls behind them to slow
                            down the pursuers or try to find a shortcut. Slowing down a pursuer moves them away by one
                            range bracket and finding a way to get away allows the player to move away by one bracket.
                            It works the same but in reverse for when the players are chasing someone, instead trying
                            to find ways to stop the person chased or finding ways to close the distance.</p>
                        <p>A chase ends when the chaser manages to stop who they are chasing, for example by moving
                            into melee range and making a check to tackle or when the range between the sides exceeds
                            distant range.</p>
                        <h3>Exchanges</h3>
                        <a id="Exchanges" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p>An <strong>exchange</strong> is a social situation where player characters are trying to
                            influence someone. This can be anything from interrogation, bribery, a courtroom trial,
                            trying to calm a crying child, or trying to convince someone to share resources or
                            information.</p>
                        <p>An exchange, like all challenges and checks, needs something the players are risking if they
                            fail. Before starting an exchange, the GM should tell the players what is at stake. Failing
                            the questioning of a drunkard at a pub might result in one of the players getting glassed
                            for 2d10 unavoidable damage, failing to convince someone to share information may make them
                            stand-offish towards the group, or failing to calm the child might cause the child to draw
                            unwanted attention or run off.</p>
                        <p>To win an exchange, one side must run out of resolve to continue it, and give in. Each
                            player character always has 1 resolve. Once all players run out of resolve, they lose the
                            exchange. At the beginning of an exchange, the GM determines how much resolve the opposing
                            side has. Note that increasing their resolve will make the exchange longer as well.</p>

                            </tbody>
                        </table>
                        <p>An exchange is played in rounds. Each round, every player character gets to play one appeal,
                            and cannot play another one until the next round. Players choose which order they will play
                            their appeals in.</p>
                        <p>To paly an appeal a player first rolls the check for the appeal they want to use against the
                            opposing side. If they are successful they roleplay what the appeal says and deal the
                            amount of resolve damage it says on the appeal. If the appeal check fails, the next player
                            makes their appeal.</p>
                        <p>If the roleplay if the appeal was exceptional, it deals an extra resolve damage. The GM
                            ultimately decides what makes an exceptional appeal, but generally it&rsquo;s one that is
                            genuinely convincing, interesting, and worthy of praise.</p>
                        <p>If the roleplay of the appeal is lacklustre, it instead deals 0 resolve damage, and the
                            appeal check is considered a failure. A lacklustre appeal is one that fails to do what the
                            appeal requires, fails to say or do anything new, or is so thoroughly unconvincing that it
                            has no effect.</p>
                        <p>After each appeal, the player who made the appeal check makes an instinct check against the
                            opposing side. If they fail the roll, they lose their resolve. This instinct check is made
                            whether or not the player was successful in their appeal check.</p>
                        <p>The exchange ends in victory, if the opposing side runs out of resolve before all the
                            players have. If all players lose their resolve before that, they fail the exchange, and
                            whatever was at stake happens.</p>
                        <p>In some cases, the GM may choose that an exchange ends early, either in player victory or
                            defeat. For example, attacking the judge at a courtroom trial will instantly lead to the
                            players failing. On the other hand, handing over a large enough amount of money to a guard
                            they are trying to bribe will lead to the players instantly winning. If the GM feels the
                            players deserve to win, they should win at that point, even if the opponents resolve
                            isn&rsquo;t at 0.</p>

                        <a id="The_Start_of_Combat" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p>At the start of combat, the GM decides which side of the battle acts first. Usually, this
                            will be the side initiating combat, the first to draw their weapons or charge forward.</p>
                        <p>If no side is acting before the others, all sides choose one character among them to make an
                            agility roll. The order of combat is defined by these rolls, with the sides with higher
                            rolls acting first. If multiple characters roll the same value, they roll between
                            themselves to determine the order.</p>
                        <h3>Rounds and Turns</h3>
                        <a id="Rounds_and_Turns" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p>Combat is broken down into rounds of combat, usually referred to as <strong>rounds</strong>.</p>
                        <p>During a round every side of the battle takes a <strong>turn </strong>one after another.</p>
                        <p>During a turn every character on that side may do various things such as cast spells, swing
                            swords, and drink potions.</p>
                        <p>Characters on the same side act simultaneously or in any order they wish. For example,
                            during a turn a character can first do something, then wait for another character to act,
                            and then do something else.</p>
                        <p>During a round every character may take an <strong>action</strong>, a <strong>minor action</strong>,
                            and they may <strong>move</strong> up to their movement.</p>
                        <p>A character may also declare that they would like to take a <strong>delayed turn</strong>
                            and act out of turn order.</p>
                        <h3>Types of Combat</h3>
                        <a id="Types_of_Combat" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p>Combat in can be played out in one of two ways: <strong>quick combat</strong> and <strong>tactical
                                combat</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Quick combat is played similarly to normal gameplay with the GM describing the situation and
                            the players telling the GM what their characters wish to do.</p>
                        <p>Tactical combat is played using a grid with tokens and follows a much more comprehensive
                            ruleset.</p>
                        <p>Generally, only relatively short and simple battles should be played using quick combat. A
                            battle with many characters or a lot of complexity is hard to keep track of without the use
                            of tokens and a grid. Tactical combat is not necessary for something simple like beating up
                            one or two guards, if anything having to set up the grid and tokens for such a battle would
                            slow the game down.</p>
                        <p>The rules do work whichever method of running combat you decide on, and you can play using
                            only one of the systems, or without any combat at all.</p>
                        <p>If you choose not to use tactical combat, you ought to avoid having large fights, and
                            instead have the game mainly be focused on things other things such as exploration,
                            investigation, or social interaction.</p>

                        <a id="Movement" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p>Every turn characters may move up to their movement, which for players is 10 tiles. You may
                            move diagonally at no additional cost.</p>
                        <p>You do not need to use all of your movement at once. You may move, take an action, move,
                            take a minor action, move, as long as your total movement does not exceed your movement.</p>
                        <p>You cannot end your move on a tile that is already occupied by another character, however
                            you may move through another character if they agree to it.</p>
                        <p><em>Jumping and climbing:</em></p>
                        <p>You can jump a number of tiles equal to your strength or 2, whichever is higher.</p>
                        <p>Every tile of movement going vertically up costs an additional point of movement. Similarly,
                            jumping a tile upwards costs 2 tiles of movement.</p>
                        <p>Falling down does not cost any movement.</p>
                        <p>Descending, for example climbing down a ladder, costs 1 movement per tile.</p>
                        <p><em>In quick combat:</em></p>
                        <p>A character moves one range unit at a time, moving from long range to short, close to melee,
                            etc.</p>
                        <h3>Shifting</h3>
                        <a id="Shifting" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p><strong>Shifting</strong> is movement that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A
                            character cannot shift unless a manoeuvre, spell, or other ability specifically allows them
                            to do so.</p>

                        <a id="Attacks" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p><strong>Attacks</strong> are a special kind of check, which most of the time require you to
                            make a roll using a d20 against the target&rsquo;s agility or instinct. If you roll a 20 on
                            an attack, the attack deals <strong>double damage</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Attacks are usually made when using a spell, manoeuvre, or a basic attack, but other cases
                            such as the usage of magical items can still ask for you to make an attack.</p>
                        <p><em>Physical attacks:</em></p>
                        <p>All attacks that are made by hitting someone with a part of their body or another object.
                            For example, unarmed attacks, attacks made with melee weapons, spell attacks that use
                            touch.</p>
                        <p><em>Ranged attacks:</em></p>
                        <p>All attacks that are made by hitting someone with a missile that is shot, or a weapon that
                            is thrown. For example, a fireball or lightning bolt spell, shooting someone with an arrow,
                            or throwing an axe.</p>
                        <p><em>Spell attacks:</em></p>
                        <p>All attacks that are a part of a spell. Spell attacks are almost always also a physical or a
                            ranged attack. Only attacks made as a part of a spell are spell attacks. If a spell mind
                            controls a character to attack someone, that is not a spell attack, since it was not part
                            of a spell, only caused by one</p>
                        <h3>Basic Attacks</h3>
                        <a id="Basic_Attacks" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p>A basic attack is a type of manoeuvre all characters have. There are many situations, such
                            as attacks of opportunity, that allow you to make a basic attack. When allowed to do a
                            basic attack you can use any manoeuvre you have with the name &lsquo;Basic Attack&rsquo;.
                            It&rsquo;s not uncommon to have multiple.</p>
                        <p>Everyone has access to an improvised basic attack, made with something you have at hand or
                            your own body.</p>
                        <p><strong><em>Improvised Basic Attack</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Time: 1 action</p>
                        <p>Range: Melee</p>
                        <p>Target: Character or object</p>
                        <p>Attack: Strength vs defence</p>
                        <p>Hit: Deal 1d6 + strength damage</p>
                        <h3>Double Damage</h3>
                        <a id="Double_Damage" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p>When an attack deals double damage, you double both the number of dice you roll, and the
                            modifier you add. So, if normally the damage would be 2d6 + 4, double damage would be 4d6 +
                            8. If you gain double damage from multiple sources, you simply increase the multiplier per
                            double damage gained. So if you gained another double damage, the 4d6 + 8 would increase to
                            6d6 + 12.</p>
                        <h3>Attacks of Opportunity</h3>
                        <a id="Attacks_of_Opportunity" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p>Doing certain things in melee range of another character may allow them to do an attack of
                            opportunity.</p>
                        <p>An attack of opportunity is a melee basic attack. You may take it with any melee weapon you
                            are carrying or make an unarmed or improvised attack.</p>
                        <p><em>Things that provoke attacks of opportunity:</em></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Casting a spell or performing a manoeuvre that states that it provokes attacks of
                                opportunity</li>
                            <li>Using a basic attack with a two-handed ranged weapon</li>
                            <li>Performing first aid action</li>
                            <li>Moving out of melee range from another creature</li>
                            <li>Moving within the melee range of another creature</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Note that this only applies to moving, not shifting<strong>.</strong></p>
                        <p>Attacks of opportunity happen before the action that provoked them is done. If a character
                            tries to move away from your melee range and your attack of opportunity makes them fall
                            unconscious, their movement is cancelled, and they stay within melee range. If a character
                            attempts a two-handed ranged weapon attack and your attack of opportunity kills them, the

                        <p>There are 3 types of weapon: one-handed melee, two-handed melee, and ranged. Each of them
                            gives you access to a basic attack manoeuvre while they are in your inventory, and you are
                            able to use them.</p>
                        <p>One-handed melee weapons take [2] inventory slots, two-handed melee weapons [4], and ranged
                            weapons [3]. The weapons themselves can be anything at all, as long as it could be used as
                            a weapon, and you are doing so. Since all of the weapons take multiple inventory slots, you
                            should write down both what the weapon is, the fact it&rsquo;s a weapon, and its damage.</p>

                        <p>As a player, when attacked you will make a defence check. Everyone can defend using agility.
                            Some abilities allow you to defend using other attributes instead.</p>
                        <p>If you have armour in your inventory, you can defend by letting the attack hit your armour.
                            The modifier for this is +1 per 2 inventory slots the armour is taking up. Shields are a part of armour.</p>

                        <h3>Grapple</h3>
                        <a id="Grapple" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p>As an action, you can attempt to grapple a character in melee range. The grappler contests
                            their strength against the target&rsquo;s strength or agility, their choice.</p>
                        <p><em>While grappling a target:</em></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>On your turn, you can choose to stop grappling the target.</li>
                            <li>You can use your movement to shift the grappled target within melee range.</li>
                            <li>You can move as long as you don&rsquo;t leave melee range of the target.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><em>While being grappled:</em></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>All attacks against you gain advantage.</li>
                            <li>You cannot move.</li>
                            <li>As a minor action, you may attempt to escape the grapple. To do so contest your agility
                                against the grappler&rsquo;s strength.</li>
                            <li>As a minor action, you may attempt to escape the grapple by counter-grappling the
                                grappler. To do so contest your strength against their strength. If you fail, you are
                                not shifted.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If the grappled character or the grappler is shifted, the grappled can choose to try to
                            escape the grapple by rolling their agility against the grapplers strength.</p>
                        <p>A character can grapple multiple different targets at the same time and a character can be
                            grappled by many grapplers at once. Attacks against a grappled target gain multiple levels
                            of advantage the more grapplers there are.</p>
                        <h3>Shove</h3>
                        <a id="Shove" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p>As an action, you can shift a character or an object in melee range back a number of tiles
                            equal to your strength, or 1 tile if your strength is negative. You can only shove
                            characters and objects that are of such a size and weight that your character could
                            realistically shove them.</p>
                        <h3>Help</h3>
                        <a id="Help" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p>You can grant advantage on one check to another character in melee range. You can only help
                            with checks your character could actually help with. For example, distracting someone to
                            make it easier for your friend to pickpocket them, reaching out to help them climb, or
                            smacking away a foe&rsquo;s shield or weapon to help your friend attack.</p>
                        <h3>Perform First Aid</h3>
                        <a id="Perform_First_Aid" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p>As an action, you can heal a bloodied character in melee range. If the healing would raise
                            the character&rsquo;s health to above half of their maximum health, they are instead healed
                            to half of their health + 1.</p>
                        <p>You cannot perform first aid on yourself.</p>
                        <p>Performing first aid provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>
                        <p>The amount of healing done increases with levels of skill in medicine (KNO).</p>

                        <h3>Delayed Turns</h3>
                        <a id="Delayed_Turns" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p>A character may disrupt the regular flow of combat by declaring that they would like to take
                            a <strong>delayed turn</strong>. This allows you to take your turn in the middle of another
                            side&rsquo;s turn.</p>
                        <p>Doing so means you cannot move, take your action or minor action, or do anything else on
                            your actual turn.</p>
                        <h3>Triggers</h3>
                        <a id="Triggers" class="anchor"></a>
                        <p>Before doing anything on your turn, declare that you would like to take a delayed turn and
                            specify what will be the <strong>trigger</strong> for it.</p>
                        <p>The trigger is a single sentence, which describes a specific circumstance upon which you
                            will start your delayed turn.</p>
                        <p>A delayed turn declaration might sound something like &ldquo;I would like to take a delayed
                            turn when a hostile character goes through the doorway closest to me.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>The trigger in this declaration is &ldquo;A hostile character goes through the doorway
                            closes to me.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>If this circumstance happens before it would be your turn again, you may then at that moment
                            interrupt the ongoing turn and take your own. The hostile character will stop just after
                            completing the circumstance of the trigger, in this case moving through the doorway.</p>
                        <p>After you take your delayed turn, the round continues from where it left off.</p>
                        <p>If the declared trigger does not come up before it&rsquo;s your turn again, you will have
                            wasted your turn.</p>
                        <p>Also note that the GM is aware of what your trigger is and is allowed to play around it, for
                            example, avoiding triggering it (although a friendly GM shouldn&rsquo;t make it their life
                            goal to avoid all triggers).</p>
                        <p>The GM is allowed to take delayed turns but should do so sparingly to not overcomplicate
                            combat. </p>
